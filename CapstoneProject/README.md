# Predicting Stock prices using Deep learning

Overview:
This project tries to predict the closing price of Google stock using Close price
as a feature.The model uses LSTM and recurrent neural network to learn the fluctuations
in the stock price.Furthermore Mean squared error is used as a cost function as well as
an error metric.

Dataset:
For this model as mentioned above the only feature used is Close price, so the dataset 
consists of Closing price of Google stock from Jan 2000 to August 2016.

Dependencies:
- keras
- tensorflow
